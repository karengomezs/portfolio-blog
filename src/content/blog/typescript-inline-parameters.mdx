# Assign types to inline parameters

---

**_Have you asked yourself how you can assign a type to a parameter? Well, it is easy, let's see._**

Remember that you have to assign a type for each [parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Parameter), it could be a [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number), [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean), [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), among others.

### Snippet String

```ts
function getFullName(name: string, lastName: string) {
  return `${name} ${lastName}`;
}

console.log(getFullName("Tim", "Jackson")); //Tim Jackson
```

### Snippet Boolean

```ts
function canOpenCookieBox(key: boolean) {
  if (key) {
    return "Get a cookie";
  }
  return "You cannot get a cookie";
}

console.log(canOpenCookieBox(true)); // Get a cookie
```

### Snippet Number

```ts
function getSum(num1: number, num2: number) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

console.log(getSum(5, 20)); //25
```

### Snippet Type Combined

```ts
function isUnderAge(name: string, age: number) {
  if (age < 18) {
    return `${name} isn't an adult`;
  }
  return `${name} is an adult`;
}

console.log(isUnderAge("Tim", 17)); //Tim isn't an adult
```

The value you pass to the function, when it's executed, has to be the same type you assigned it when the function was declared.
If it's not, the contract is not fulfilled and there will be an Error, for example:

```ts
function getFullName(name: string, lastName: string) {
  return `${name} ${lastName}`;
}

console.log(getFullName("Tim", 1));

Error: "Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.";
```

That's all, now yo know how to assign types easily 👌🏽!
