# Assign types to obejcts, arrays and variables

---

**_If you want to learn to assign different types to different data, here there are some ways_**

To do this, you can use [Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-tooling-in-5-minutes.html#interfaces) and [Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html), interfaces are like a "contract", it specifies the content, properties or functions to implement or meet the contract. Remember that **it does not contain** values or code in your functions. Let's do it!

### Snippet Variable

```ts
//First Example
let num1: number = 1;
const word: string = "hello";
let boo: boolean = true;
const arr1: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2: number[] = [4, 5, 6];
const obj1: object = { x: 1 };
let obj2: any = { y: "hello" };

//Using Type
type Word = string;
const word3: Word = "hello";
```
